description: "Boon is a 1915 work of literary satire by H. G. Wells. It purports,\
  \ however, to be by the fictional character Reginald Bliss, and for some time after\
  \ publication Wells denied authorship. Boon is best known for its part in Wells's\
  \ debate on the nature of literature with Henry James, who is caricatured in the\
  \ book. But in Boon Wells also mocks himself, calling into question and ridiculing\
  \ a notion he held dearâ€”that of humanity's collective consciousness.\n From Wikipedia\
